# PAC

A proof-of-concept distributed computing architecture build on rust and webassembly.

## About

PAC or Packaged Assembly for Compute is a proof-of-concept distributed computing architecture made in under 36 hours
for [Hack Frost NL](https://hackfrostnl.ca/). The goal is to provide a simpler way for users to contribute computing
power to scientific endeavors like BOINC and Folding@home while allowing developers to spend less time on multiplatform
support and distribution.

## Demo
